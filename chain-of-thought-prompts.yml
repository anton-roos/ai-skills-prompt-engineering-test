# Chain-of-Thought Prompt Practice

# System Architecture Decision
prompt: |
  You need to choose between REST API and GraphQL for a WhatsApp integration service. Walk me through your decision-making process step by step:
  
  1. First, analyze the specific requirements of WhatsApp integration
  2. Then, compare how REST and GraphQL handle these requirements
  3. Consider the trade-offs in terms of performance, complexity, and maintainability
  4. Factor in team expertise and existing infrastructure
  5. Finally, make a recommendation with clear reasoning
  
  Think through each step carefully and explain your reasoning.

# Debugging Strategy
prompt: |
  A WhatsApp integration is experiencing intermittent message delivery failures (about 15% of messages fail). Walk me through a systematic debugging approach:
  
  1. Start by identifying what information you need to gather
  2. Explain how you would reproduce the issue
  3. Describe the step-by-step investigation process
  4. Detail how you would isolate the root cause
  5. Outline potential solutions and how to validate them
  6. Explain how you would prevent this issue in the future
  
  Be thorough in explaining your reasoning at each step.

# Cost Optimization Analysis
prompt: |
  Your WhatsApp Business API costs have increased by 300% this month. Analyze this step by step:
  
  1. First, identify what data you need to collect to understand the cost increase
  2. Then, analyze potential causes (traffic spike, pricing changes, inefficient usage, etc.)
  3. Evaluate each potential cause based on likelihood and impact
  4. Propose specific investigation steps for the most likely causes
  5. Suggest optimization strategies for each identified issue
  6. Prioritize solutions based on effort vs. impact
  7. Create a monitoring plan to prevent future surprises
  
  Show your complete thought process for each step.

# Security Risk Assessment
prompt: |
  A new team member suggests storing WhatsApp webhook secrets in environment variables on the production server. Evaluate this proposal step by step:
  
  1. First, identify what security principles are at stake
  2. Analyze the current proposal's security implications
  3. Consider potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities
  4. Evaluate alternative approaches and their trade-offs
  5. Factor in operational complexity and team capabilities
  6. Make a recommendation with supporting rationale
  7. Suggest implementation steps if changes are needed
  
  Walk through your security analysis systematically.

# Performance Optimization
prompt: |
  Your WhatsApp integration handles 1000 messages/hour, but you need to scale to 10,000 messages/hour. Think through an optimization strategy:
  
  1. Start by analyzing current performance bottlenecks
  2. Identify which components will hit limits first
  3. Consider different scaling approaches (vertical vs horizontal)
  4. Evaluate the impact on system reliability and complexity
  5. Factor in cost implications of each approach
  6. Plan implementation phases to minimize risk
  7. Define success metrics and monitoring strategy
  
  Show your complete reasoning for each optimization decision.
